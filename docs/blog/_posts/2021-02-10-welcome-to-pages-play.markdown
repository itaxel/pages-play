This is the standard jekyl file name and format.
Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

For example 2021-02-10-welcome-to-pages-play.markup for this file.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight html %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}
